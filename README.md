# Discrypt
 Discord Encryption in the browser

# Initial Release
* Not suitable for use; password is ``default23``. 
* No ability to change password.
* Is relatively hacked together but pretty stable! Thank React for both of those.

# WIP
* Changing passwords.
* Add Decrypt button when a new message appears (using a MutationObserver).
